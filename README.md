These are my solutions to Advent of Code 2019, written in Go.   
each day has a folder that contains two folders for the two parts of the day.

I will probably revisit my solutions when I have some free time and create another version that is better optimized.

Im also currently Developing a [Assembler like language (and compiler)](https://github.com/LeMoonStar/AoCIntcodeCompiler) for the intcode
